# old_car_price_prediction
The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning-based model that can predict car prices with a high degree of accuracy. By analyzing historical data and identifying key variables that affect price, this model will assist users in estimating the market value of different car models. This solution is intended for use by car dealers, consumers, and valuation platforms.
The Car Price Prediction system is a machine learning application built using Python and libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas. It predicts car prices based on user inputs such as make, model, mileage, and year.
Achieved a validation accuracy of 89%(adjust as needed).
